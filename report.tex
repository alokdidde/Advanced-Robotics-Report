\chapter{Introduction}
The report presents a comprehensive overview of the research conducted on enhancing agricultural efficiency through the integration of advanced technologies such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), object detection algorithms, Large Language Models (LLM), and Visual Language Action Models (VLAMs). These technologies have the potential to revolutionize crop management practices by providing detailed environmental mapping, precise identification of crop conditions, intelligent agent planning, and enhanced natural language interaction. The report outlines the methodology used to integrate these technologies and discusses the results obtained from the experiments conducted. The findings demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of leveraging these technologies for improving agricultural productivity and sustainability.
